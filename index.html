			<h1>Pixen</h1>
			<h3>pixel art editor for Mac OS X</h3>
			<p>Pixen is a pixel art editor designed for working with low-resolution raster art, such as those 8-bit sprites found in old-school video games. With innovative features like a color palette system, patterns, and high-zoom support, Pixen packs all the tools pixel artists need in an intuitive, Mac-native interface. Pixen also makes creating frame-by-frame animations fun and easy.</p>

			<h2>Animations</h2>
			<p>Create and arrange image frames in the film strip to piece together animations. You can import animated GIFs and PNGs; export animations as animated GIFs, QuickTime movies, or spritesheets!</p>

			<h2>Tools</h2>
			<p>Leverage Pixen's wide array of tools when composing pixel art: Pencil, Eraser, Eyedropper, Zoom, Rectangular Selection, Magic Wand, Lasso, Move, Fill, Line, Rectangle, and Ellipse.</p>

			<h2>Layers</h2>
			<p>Take advantage of the flexibility layers provide when working with complex pixel art.</p>
			
			<h2>Color Palettes</h2>
			<p>Add and organize commonly-used colors into palettes.</p>
			
			<h2>Patterns</h2>
			<p>Define custom patterns to use while drawing with the Pencil, Line, or Eraser tool (instead of a single pixel).</p>
			
			<h2>Custom Backgrounds</h2>
			<p>Pick a flat, striped, or checkered background (or even a custom image) to be shown beneath the canvas.</p>
			
			<h2>Grid + Alignment Crosshair</h2>
			<p>Let the Grid and the Alignment Crosshair guide you in placing pixels just where you want them.</p>
			
			<h2>Preview</h2>
			<p>While editing at high zoom levels, use the Preview window to view the canvas scaled out; play back animations in the Preview window.</p>
			
			<h2>Left and Right Tools</h2>
			<p>Assign a different tool to the left and right mouse button. For example: pencil on the left; eraser on the right.</p>
			
			<h2>Tablet Support</h2>
			<p>Pixen supports pressure-sensitive drawing tablets and maps pressure to color opacity.</p>
			
			<h2>Hotkeys</h2>
			<p>Customize tool hotkeys to ease the transition from other image editors.</p>
			
			<h2>Full Screen</h2>
			<p>Work with all your favorite tools in full screen mode.</p>
